For example, if we enumerate the cities according to alphabetical order, the first city `'Aracaju (SE)'` would correspond to $0$. Each row of the file corresponds to one flight, i.e. it has a starting city and an ending city. We model this as a stationary Markov chain, i.e. each user's travel trajectory is a realization of the Markov chain, $X_t$. Here, $X_t$ is the current city the user is at, at step $t$, and $X_{t+1}$ is the city the user travels to at the next time step. This means that to each row in the file there is a corresponding pair $(X_{t},X_{t+1})$. The stationarity assumption gives that for all $t$ there is a transition density $p$ such that $P(X_{t+1} = y | X_t = x) = p(x,y)$ (for all $x,y$). The transition matrix should be `n_cities` x `n_citites` in size.\n",

    "NOTE: When setting bounding boxes for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ try to start with some guesses like $[-20,20]$ and $[0.1,5.0]$ and make it larger if the solution is at the boundary. Making the left bounding-point for $\\sigma$ too close to $0.0$ will cause division by zero Warnings. Other numerical instabilities can happen in such iterative numerical solutions to the MLe. You need to be patient and learn by trial-and-error. You will see the mathematical theory in more details in a future course in scientific computing/optimisation. So don't worry too much now except learning to use it for our problems.  "
