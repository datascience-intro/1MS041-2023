    "### Parameters, Models and Real Life\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by parametric estimation?  In parametric estimation, we assume that the data comes from a particular type of probability distribution and we try to estimate the parameters of that distribution.  What are parameters, in a statistical sense?  Remember the $Bernoulli(\\theta)$ random variable?  A $Bernoulli$ distribution has one parameter, usually denoted as $\\theta$.  We talked about modelling events such as the outcome of a toss of a coin as using the $Bernoulli(\\theta)$ random variable.  If the coin is fair then, in our model, $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$.  If the random variable $X$ takes value 1 when the fair coin lands heads, then we model $P(X = 1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we speak about the probability of observing events such as the outcome of a toss of a coin, we are assuming some kind of model.  In the case of a coin, the model is a $Bernoulli$ RV. This model would have one parameter,  the probability of the coin landing heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we introduced the $Exponential$ distribution, we talked about the $Exponential(\\lambda$) RV, or the $Exponential$ parameterised by $\\lambda$.  Distributions can be parameterised by more than one quantity.  We have already met the $Uniform(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ - this has two parameters, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$.  Another distribution you may be familiar with, although we have not discussed it in this course, is the Normal distribution which is parameterised by $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$.   The symbols like $\\theta$, $\\lambda$, $\\mu$, $\\sigma$ are conventionally used for the parameters of these distributions.  It is useful to  become familiar with these conventions (see for example Wikipedia on the Exponential  or Normal)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many applications of computational statistics which involve models of real life events, and it is not enough to say \"this can be modeled with a $Bernoulli$ RV\", or \"Orbiter bus inter-arrival times can be modelled with an $Exponential$ RV\".  We also have to choose parameters for our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also remind ourselves that the probabilty density function (probability mass function for a discrete random variable) and distribution function depend on the parameters when we write them.  In the case of the $Bernoulli$, for example, the probability mass function is denoted by  $f(x;\\theta)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, we are usually not trying to do \"textbook\" examples like calculating the probability of an event given a distribution and parameter value(s).  We may be able to see the outcomes of a process, but we can never know exactly what that process is, all we can do is try to find a useful model for it.  We are trying to use the information available to us in the form of observations or data to make our models, including guessing/estimating values for the model parameters.   We have to turn our thinking around and focus on what the data can tell us about the model.  In particular, in this course, we focus on what the data can tell us about model parameters - parametric estimation.   Now is a good time to reflect on these words of the renowned Statisticians:\n",

    "### The Likelihood Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Likelihood, as we said above, is a fundamental concept in statistical inference (\"inference\" - making inferences from observations, making guesses based on information in data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In informal terms, likelihood is \"the likelihood of the parameters for the observed data\".  More formally, *likelihood is a function of the parameter and is proportional to the conditional probability of the data given the parameter*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can talk about a likelihood function where the domain of the likelihood function is all the possible values for the parameters (remember, a function is a mapping from a domain to a range): the likelihood function is a mapping from possible values for the parameters to the likelihood of those parameters for the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood function of $\\theta$ based on $n$ observations $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ is denoted $L_n(\\theta)$.  We have said that it is a mapping from \"all possible values for the parameters\", i.e. all possible values for $\\theta$, to the likelihood of those parameters given the data $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$.  In our formal notation, if we know that $\\theta$ must be somewhere in the parameter space ${\\mathbf{\\Theta}}$, then $L_n(\\theta)$ is a mapping from $\\mathbf{\\Theta}$ to the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_n(\\theta): \\mathbf{\\Theta} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of a $Bernoulli(\\theta)$ RV, we know that the parameter $\\theta$ must be between $0$ and $1$, or $\\theta \\in [0,1]$.  In the case of an $Exponential(\\lambda)$ random variable parameterised by $\\lambda$, we know $\\lambda > 0$, i.e., $\\lambda \\in \\mathbf{\\Lambda} = (0,\\infty)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: $\\Lambda$ is the Greek upper-case of $\\lambda$, which as usual we reserve for random variables taking values in $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$. These distinctions are not too impotant for this course, and we will keep the notation light here, but when you learn more advanced concepts in statistical machine learning and Bayesian inference, it will become very important to keep the notations clear between samples, random variables and the space where they take their values for data, statistics and parameters (which themselves become random variables in advanced courses you may take in a couple years).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on the likelihood function for independent and identically distributed (IID) random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n$ as $n$ independent random variables and they are all identically distributed with $f(x;\\theta)$.   We would write this as $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n \\overset{IID}{\\sim} f(x;\\theta)$. Here $(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n)$ is an $\\mathbb{R}^n$-valued random variable (sometimes called a random vector). Then, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n \\overset{IID}{\\sim} f(x;\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "merely means, due to independent and identical distribution among all $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n$, that the $\\mathbb{R}^n$-valued random variable $(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n)$ has joint density:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n; \\theta) = f(x_1;\\theta)\\times f(x_2;\\theta) \\times \\cdots \\times f(x_n;\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i;\\theta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $f(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n; \\theta)$ is termed the joint density of the data $(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n)$ for a given $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, when $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n \\overset{IID}{\\sim} f(x;\\theta)$ the joint density $f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n; \\theta)$ is the product of the individual densities $\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i ; \\theta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Now, we are going to apply what we have learned about maximum likelihood estimates to the the NZ lotto data we looked at earlier in the course.  Specifically, we are interested in whether Ball One is odd or even.   This can be considered as a Bernoulli random variable where the outcome is 1 if the number drawn for Ball One is odd, and 0 if the number drawn is even.   The observed outcomes of the draws for Ball One are modelled as independently and identically distributed (IID) realisations of the $Bernoulli(\\theta^*)$ random variable.    Thus our probability model is:\n",

Then, using the function  solve  we can solve equations, i.e. use Sympy to find the value(s) of a variable which would solve the equation of interest, or expressions for one variable in terms of other variables involved in the equation(s).\n",
