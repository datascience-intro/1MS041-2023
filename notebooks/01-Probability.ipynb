    "An **experiment** is an activity or procedure that produces distinct or well-defined outcomes.  The *set* of such outcomes is called the **sample space** of the experiment.  The sample space is usually denoted with the symbol $\\Omega$.  Lets look at some examples of experiments.\n",

    "### Roll a dice experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "If our experiment is to roll a dice wth faces painted $red$, $green$, $yellow$, $pink$, $blue$ and $black$ and find what colour the top face is at the end of each roll, then the sample space $\\Omega = \\{red, green, yellow, pink, blue, black\\}$.\n",

    "### Flip a coin experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "If our experiment is to flip a coin where the two faces of the coin can be identified as 'heads' ($H$) and 'tails' ($T$), and we are interested in what face lands uppermost, then the sample space is $\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}$.\n",

    "So we have probabilities associated with events satisfying some axioms --  that sounds like a good use for a dictionary?   That's basically what are going to use, but we 'wrap' up the dictionary in some extra code that does things like check that the probabilities add to 1, and that each element in the list of outcomes we have given is unique.   If you are interested in programming, we have coded our own type, or class, called `ProbyMap` (it's given in the next cell, and you can simply evaluate it and ignore all the details completely!).   Once the class is coded, we create a `ProbyMap` by providing the sample space and the probabilities.   You don't have to worry about how the class is implemented, but note that you may often want to use the computer to create a **computerised representation of a mathematical concept**.  Once the concept (a discrete probability map in our case) is implemenetd, then we can use the computer to automate the mundane tasks of large-scale computations."
